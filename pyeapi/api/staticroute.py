"""Module for working with EOS static routes

The staticroute resource provides configuration management of static
route resources on an EOS node. It provides the following class
implementations:

    * StaticRoute - Configure static routes in EOS

StaticRoute Attributes:
    ip_dest (string): The ip address of the destination in the
        form of A.B.C.D/E

    next_hop (string): The next hop interface or ip address
    next_hop_ip (string): The next hop address on destination interface
    distance (int): Administrative distance for this route
    tag (int): Route tag
    route_name (string): Route name

Notes:
    The 'default' prefix function of the 'ip route' command,
    'default ip route ...', currently equivalent to the 'no ip route ...'
    command.
